# Power-bi-Dashboard



### Just launched a Banking Dashboard Project using Power BI!

I built an interactive and insightful dashboard focused on core areas of the banking domain to help uncover key business trends and support decision-making.

🔍 Dashboard Sections Include:
🏠 Home Page – Overview of the bank’s performance and navigation to key sections
💳 Loan Analysis – Trends in loan approvals, types, and customer behavior
💰 Deposit Analysis – Insights into customer deposits and growth patterns
📊 Summary Page – Consolidated view of major KPIs and actionable insights

This project helped me sharpen my skills in data modeling, visualization, and dashboard design — turning raw data into a clear story.

✅ Tools Used: Power BI | DAX | Data Modeling | Design Principles

Excited to keep exploring more real-world data scenarios and build impactful solutions!
